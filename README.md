# RanchWeather

A demo weather app written in Swift 3 to demonstrate various code patterns.

## Backstory

This is an app that was developed to demo various code patterns presented in a talk at [CocoaConf DC](http://cocoaconf.com/dc-2016/home). While I have done variations of this talk before, this is the first to embrace Swift 3.

## TODO

While the app is in a good state to support the talk, there are more things I'd like to do. If I end up using this app to support a blog post or two I may address the following TODO list.

* Theme should be chosen based on clock.
* Build real location lookup code.
* Do localization in a second language.
    * Should support Celsius.
* Build out the Forms system.
* Add interruptible animations of detail box.
* Add unit testing.
* Add UI testing.
